You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Inertiajs, Adonisjs v6, React, and shadcn/ui(base-ui)
  
  Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  
  Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  
  TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
  
  Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
  - Use shadcn/ui components instead of raw tailwind classes when possible
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  - DRY - Create components if necessary. Don't repeat the same UI styling if a component could be created and re-used
  
  UI and Styling
  - Use shadcn/ui components primarily (Button, Input, Label, Card, Alert, Checkbox, etc.)
  - Components are located in ./inertia/components/ui/
  - Use a mobile-first approach.
  - Use lucide-react for icons
  - Use the cn() utility from @/lib/utils for conditional className merging
  
  Performance Optimization
  
  Key Conventions
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).

  UI
  - Pages are ui related code are found in the ./inertia/pages
  - Emails are found in ./inertia/emails. Emails are built with react-email and always wrap each email in a layout found here [layout.tsx](mdc:inertia/emails/layout.tsx)
  
  - Keep the code DRY, create re-useable components if you believe such a component would be reused again
  - Don't repeat typescript types and interfaces across multiple files. create a .model.ts file
  - When creating a new page or component, use shadcn/ui components from @/components/ui/
  - Always create new files using snake_casing
  
  shadcn/ui Setup
  - Configuration: components.json in project root
  - Components: inertia/components/ui/
  - Utilities: inertia/lib/utils.ts (cn function)
  - CSS variables: resources/css/app.css
  - Path alias: @ → ./inertia/
  - Add new components via CLI: npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]

  Adonisjs
  - I prefer to use model.merge() instead of setting properties directly.
  user.merge({ name: 'John Doe' }).save()
  
- Follow adonisjs, shadcn and tailwind docs for help if need be.
